# Hospital-Length-of-Stay-Visualisation

**Overview**
This repository contains Tableau visualizations that analyze and display the analysis of the predicted length of stay for patients admitted to a hospital (100,000 data points). The visualizations aim to provide insights into the accuracy of predictions and the factors influencing patient stays.

**Data Source**
https://microsoft.github.io/r-server-hospital-length-of-stay/input_data.html

**Visualizations**
-  Actual vs Predicted Length of Stay: A scatter plot with a perfect prediction line to visualize model accuracy.
-  Feature Analysis: Bar charts showing the impact of different patient conditions on length of stay.
-  Residual Analysis: A visualization of prediction errors, highlighting the distribution of residuals to identify over- and under-predictions.
-  Distribution of Prediction Error: Provides insights into how the model's predicted length of stay deviates from the actual values.

**Key Insights**
=  Model Accuracy: Compare actual and predicted values to evaluate model performance.
-  Influential Factors: Identify key variables like glucose levels, Sodium, and Pulse that affect the length of stay.
-  Error Analysis: Visualize residuals to understand where the model performs well and where adjustments may be needed.

**Technologies Used**
-  Tableau: For creating interactive and user-friendly dashboards.
-  Python: Data preparation and export for Tableau.
